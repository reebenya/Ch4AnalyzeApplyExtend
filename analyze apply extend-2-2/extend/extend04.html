                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->
                <p>Color Converter Used: I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp?color=ffa500">W3Schools.com</a> as my online color converter. </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>Hexadecimal color codes use a combination of six characters, representing three pairs of hexadecimal numbers (0-9 and A-F) that specify the intensity of red, green, and blue (RGB) light in a color. RGB color codes specify colors based on the intensity of red, green, and blue light in the color spectrum. Each color channel is represented by a value between 0 and 255, indicating the intensity of that color. HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. HSL color codes represent colors based on their hue (the type of color, such as red, blue, or green), saturation (the intensity or purity of the color), and lightness (the brightness of the color).</p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: Hexadecimal. I prefer this color code due to it's simplicity of only needing to use one numerical value instead of many different values, which leaves room for potential error.</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>HWB summary- HWB (Hue, Whiteness, Blackness) is a color model that describes colors based on three components: hue, representing the type of color; whiteness, indicating how much white is mixed with the color; and blackness, indicating how much black is mixed with the color. This model is similar to HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) but offers a different approach to specifying colors, particularly useful for certain design applications where hue and the balance between white and black are important factors.</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK summary- CMYK color is a color model used primarily in printing. It stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (black). In this model, colors are created by overlapping different percentages of transparent cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks on a white substrate. CMYK is a subtractive color model, meaning that the more ink is added, the darker the color becomes. It is widely used in the printing industry for producing a wide range of colors, including full-color photographs and graphics. CMYK color values are typically represented as percentages, with 0% indicating no ink and 100% indicating full saturation of the respective color.</p>
